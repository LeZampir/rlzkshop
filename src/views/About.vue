    <h1>About this webshop</h1>
      <p>
        This shop has been built from scratch with the power of Vue, Vuetify and magic of Google's Firebase. <br>
        This is a project for the 3rd Semester of Multimedia Design, primarily in the Progressive Web Application subject.<br>
        My name is Sir Ralzik, and I welcome you to my shop.
